to understand the user's individual interests using the Identified Computer.
Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example),
we will have no way of knowing who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your
computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you
supply (an example of this is when you ask for our Personalised Horoscope). A
cookie cannot read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers may also assign
their own cookies to your browser (if you click on their ads), a process that
we do not control.<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's
connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our site.
(Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know
where to send you data -- such as the web pages you view.) Your IP address does
not identify you personally. We use this information to deliver our web pages
to you upon request, to tailor our site to the interests of our users, to
measure traffic within our site and let advertisers know the geographic
locations from where our visitors come.<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to

All information gathered on our Website is securely stored within our

However the internet is an ever evolving medium. We may change our Privacy Policy
